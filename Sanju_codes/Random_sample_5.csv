A240FRPD4MEXND,B000227PL8,5.0,"12 4, 2007",1196726400,More Ports - Less Desk Space - Mikey Likes It!,"Problem:It seems there's always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop, but I've long since run out of ports for plugging.  In desperation, I bought a 4-port hub (working just fine, thank you), but I still did not have enough ports to do the job.  And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.Solution:Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub.  Space-saving solution to running out of ports.  And, with its own power supply, it's not draining power from my laptop.  Works like a charm!I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.I'm a happy camper now, and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space.  I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery.  Problem solved!P.S.  Mikey is my cat.  He likes this hub and shows it by periodically knocking it off my desk.I would prefer that Mikey didn't like it!",10
AW5JSQCHC2ZJO,B008VOPF8O,4.0,"10 16, 2012",1350345600,Jabra Tour Bluetooth,"I've had similar products before and I wasn't happy with the sound quality.  The Jabra Tour Bluetooth has a much better sound from the speakerphone; in fact it's darn near perfect.  The sound on the other end of the phone (the person not listening through the Jabra) is better than other products I've used, but not quite perfect.  Other speakerphones would tend to cut-out early in pauses when I'm talking, and the Jabra does a much better job of avoiding that.  I know I'm probably not making myself clear, here.  Haha.  But, I'm just saying that I prefer this bluetooth over others.  For the price, I think it's very good.  The ease of set-up is fantastic.  Very simple.",10
AXOZKH3BOFMF9,B00727FE5U,4.0,"01 10, 2013",1357776000,Great Audio,"I bought this to add Bluetooth to my car. The audio sounds great. I couldn't tell a difference between this and a regular 3.5mm cable. Pairing the device took a bit of effort, simply because I didn't hold the button on the device for long enough. Once it was paired with my phone the device would automatically connect everytime it turned on. My only complaint with this would be having to manually turn it on every time I got in the car. I wanted to hide it in the glove compartment and have it be powered from USB. However, the device doesn't turn itself on when the car starts, so I always had to keep it within arms reach. I would have also have liked a microphone on the device, as it confused my phone until I tweaked the phone settings. Overall, this device is great for listening to music over a Bluetooth connection.",10

ABAQXOHSBOFSC,B001ZTZ8Y8,3.0,"07 28, 2012",1343433600,good tools--battery not so sure,"I put this battery in a troubled phone, and after lots of tinkering the phone still died. So I can't tell for sure whether the battery had anything to do with that. But I love the tools! I've taken apart and fixed about 5 iphones with these tools. It's hard to find a small Philips screwdriver for the iPhone.",5
